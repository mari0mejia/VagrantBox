//This code is error-free. A common bug is to get "Variable ... was not declared" errors.
//The source of this bug is in the four rules of the variable: production. 
//
//Using Scope_manager::defined_in_current_scope() to determine if a variable has been
//declared is incorrect. That only checks the top table in the stack. The correct
//call is Scope_manager::lookup() because it will check all tables for the existence
//of the variable.
