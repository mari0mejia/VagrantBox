bison:
	* takes token directives
	* includes whatever libraries needed to run 
	* includes rules that describe the grammar 
	* includes main funciton that incloses the yyparsefunciton that calls our lexical analyzer

extra:
	123 is types regular expression for integer is triggered then
	whatever was in regular expression action gets turned into a INT
	from a STRING which we then return the token for what we want our 
	parser to recieve. Parser will then match the token with a specific         grammar rule and then perform whatver action is provided.
